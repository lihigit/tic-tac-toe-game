# Lihi's Tic-Tac-Toe 
## A textual tic-tac-toe game presenting 4 optional players.

1. **Human**.
Plus 3 computer players: 
2. **Easy** - easy to beat. 
3. **Medium** - sees one move ahead. 
4. **Impossible** - you cannot beat this one as it sees all moves ahead that are needed for win/tie. 

You can play against a friend or against one of the AIs, or even set a match between 2 of my computer players!

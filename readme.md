# Lihi's Tic-Tac-Toe 
## A textual tic-tac-toe game presenting 4 optional players

1. **Human**.
2. **Easy** - easy to beat AI. 
3. **Medium** - AI that "sees" one move ahead. 
4. **Impossible** - no one can beat this AI, as it "sees" all moves ahead that are needed for a win/tie. Implemented using [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

You can play against a friend or against one of the AIs, or even set a match between 2 of my computer players!
